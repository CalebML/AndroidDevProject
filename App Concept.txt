App concept notes: 
Narratives
The purpose of this app is to allow a user to search for a movie or TV show and easily see where it can be streamed.  On first launch the user will be prompted to pick what streaming services they use (or want to see results from), then asked to sign into their accounts (at least Netflix, if it is picked).
